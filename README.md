Hello all!
I have recently finished a web development bootcamp course on Udemy, and I am looking to review and refine my skills through the Odin Project. I also hope to learn React and improve my Git skills with this course.
Thanks!

Looking at this current assignment, I will likely skip to CSS/Bootstrap since this is just HTML practice.

Nevermind, I will work through the assignment since it is required.
